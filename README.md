# Educational E-Commerce UI Clone

This repository contains a structural clone of a high-volume e-commerce homepage, inspired by platforms like AliExpress. It is created strictly for educational purposes to demonstrate modern web layout techniques.

## Learning Objectives

1.  **Complex Layouts**: Implementing a 3-column Hero section with a sidebar, main banner, and user widget.
2.  **CSS Positioning**: Handling sticky headers, dropdown menus, and absolute positioning for badges.
3.  **Responsive Design**: Using Media Queries to adapt the complex grid for mobile devices.
4.  **Vanilla JS DOM Manipulation**: Dynamically rendering product cards.

## Structure

*   `index.html`: Semantic HTML5 structure.
*   `styles.css`: CSS using Variables, Flexbox, and Grid.
*   `script.js`: Simple logic to simulate data fetching and rendering.

## How to Run

Simply open `index.html` in any modern web browser. No build step required.
